# Frontend
- Delete unuseful comments (only include comments that explain how something works)
- app.js should be inside the client folder, would normally be called index.js and the file you have in client/index.js would be app.js
- index.js represents the first place you would go in that directory
- combine functionality in accountInfo.js and user.js reducer files
- don't put empty files into master (or anything that's functionality isn't finished)

# Backend
- order and orders in server/api are redundant

# General
- write down styleguide somewhere
